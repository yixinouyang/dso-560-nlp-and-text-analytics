    ">*To make them compact and fast, spaCy’s small models (all packages that end in `sm`) don’t ship with **true word vectors**, and only include context-sensitive tensors. This means you can still use the `similarity()` methods to compare documents, spans and tokens – but the result won’t be as good, and individual tokens won’t have any vectors assigned. So in order to use real word vectors, you need to download a larger model*.\n",
